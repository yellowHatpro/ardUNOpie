## Stepper Motors

- Stepper motors, due to their unique design, can be controlled to a high degree of accuracy without any feedback mechanisms.
- The shaft of a stepper, mounted with a series of magnets, is controlled by a series of electromagnetic coils that are charged sitively and negatively in a specific sequence,
  precisely moving it forward or backward in small "steps".
- There are two types of steppers, Unipolars and Bipolars.

### Unipolar Stepper Motors:

Unipolar steppers typically have five, six, or eight wires.
Current flows in one direction in Unipolar stepper motors

### Bipolar Stepper Motors:

Bipolar steppers have a single coil per phase and require more complicated control circuitry (typically an H-bridge for each phase).
The current flow through a coil in one direction and then in reverse.
To begin, if your stepper motor only has four wires, this means it can only be used with a bipolar driver.
